SwiftUI-MVVMC-Core is a module designed to support building SwiftUI applications using the MVVM-C (Model-View-ViewModel-Coordinator) architecture. The goal of this module is to provide a foundational structure to help you organize your code, extend functionalities, and manage navigation flows in SwiftUI applications.

# Key Features
- Coordinator Pattern: Clear and extensible navigation flow management.
- Dependency Injection: Integrated dependency injection to minimize direct dependencies between classes.
- MVVM Core: Organize ViewModel and Model to ensure separation of concerns.

- Modular Architecture: Easily extendable and integrable into large-scale projects.
